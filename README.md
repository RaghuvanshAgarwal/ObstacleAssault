# Obstacle Assualt
This is a small game I made as part of my learning curriculum of [Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/?couponCode=CP130525). In this game you have to reach the top of the level in order to win, but you first have to deal with moving platforms and rotating pads which are ready to stop you from reaching the top.
